# LearningLatin
A is a 'flash card' system for elementary latin students to utilize as they study some basic concepts.
It includes quiz sets for some verbs and nouns. There are sets that go from Latin to English and English to Latin.

The LearningMode allows students to review concepts such as verb conjugation endings, noun declension endings, 
irregular verbs, and the dictionary entries of some verbs and nouns.

Future enhancements will include the first two chapters of the Learn to Read Latin textbook along with a learning
set for grammar (such as ablative of means, dative of reference, etc).

The aim of this system is to create a low-risk environment for Latin students to review key concepts in one space, 
without the need to flip through a textbook or depend too greatly on the Perseus Digital Library.
